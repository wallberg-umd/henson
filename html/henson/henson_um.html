               <p>In 1954, Jim Henson entered the University of Maryland as a major in studio art. The multitude of artwork that survives from this point in Jim"s career indicates that he had a colorful visual imagination, a sharp eye for detail, and a creative knack for design. As a freshman at the University of Maryland, Jim was given the opportunity hone his puppetry skills during a course taught by <a href="http://hdl.handle.net/1903.1/19432">Edward Longley</a> in the Home Economics Department, as well as through practical experience. His earliest endeavors into television took place immediately before and during his time as an undergraduate at UMD.  While a student in a puppetry class, he met fellow University of Maryland student Jane Nebel, who was an early partner in his television shows and would later become his wife. </p>
              <p>Following a short-lived morning puppet segment on a local Washington station, Jim was hired by WRC-TV in 1955 to create a five-minute puppet show that would air twice nightly.  Entitled <em>Sam and Friends</em>, this program earned Henson his first Emmy in 1958 -- two years before his graduation from the University of Maryland. For <em>Sam and Friends</em>, Henson introduced many of the elements that would become mainstays of his <em>Muppet Show</em> aesthetic -- music, zany humor, and an early Kermit as a lizard-like creature. During his time at Maryland and WRC-TV, Jim Henson began to develop innovative puppetry skills that made his Muppets life-like and expressive, and that would have a profound effect on the way puppetry would be performed for television and films. </p>
<p>The <em>Jim Henson  Collection</em> includes viewing copies of important Henson works, such as  compilations of early works including commercials and <em>Sam and Friends </em>segments, <em>The  Muppet Show</em>, <em>Fraggle Rock</em>, and  the <em>Muppet Babies</em>, as well as other  numerous television specials. The collection is accessible through an online  digital project known as <em>The Jim Henson  Works at the University of Maryland</em>.</p>
           <p>  His legacy of imagination, humor, and creativity is a gift  to both young and old alike. In Jim Henson’s own words, “I believe in taking a  positive attitude toward the world, toward people, and toward my work. I think  I’m here for a purpose. I think it’s likely that we all are, but I’m only sure  about myself.”</p>
