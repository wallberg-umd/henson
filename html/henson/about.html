               <p>"Work was play, and he loved a good game." – Cheryl Henson</p>
               <p>In January 2005, The Jane Henson Foundation and The Jim Henson 
                  Legacy generously donated videos and funding to support the 
                  creation of what is now known as The Jim Henson Works at the 
                  University of Maryland. This collection makes available to UMD’s 
                  community of students, scholars, and visitors over 70 digital 
                  videos spanning 35 years of Henson’s groundbreaking work in
                   television and film. These full-length videos are available 
                  for viewing at public computer stations in the 
		Michelle Smith Performing Arts Library, McKeldin Library, and 
		Hornbake Library.
               </p>
	       <p>The University provides a wide range of research opportunities into 
		Henson's work and puppetry in the performing arts. It also hosts exhibits
		 and websites, develops interactive interpretive content, and takes part in 
		celebrations of Jim Henson's life. 
	       </p>
              
               <p>From the very beginning, Jim Henson and his Muppets combined play 
                  and learning through singing, dancing, and acting, all with the
                   timeless use of puppets as performance objects. It is ideal this
                   collection resides within the Michelle Smith Performing Arts 
                  Library at the Clarice Smith Performing Arts Center, as the Center
                   is a leading academic institution training future performance 
                  professionals and scholars. Each resident department of the Center
                   will find its own use for such a collection: the Theatre 
                  Department now hosts a Jim Henson Artist in Residence and offers
                   courses in puppetry, the School of Music offers various classes
                   in popular music and culture, and the Dance Department is known
                   for its cutting edge performance program where multidisciplinary
                   projects are encouraged. Yet, elsewhere on campus, this collection
                   will also be of use to UMD’s American Studies program where 
                  studies in popular culture and humor are offered.
               </p>
               <p>Really, the possibilities are endless. </p>
